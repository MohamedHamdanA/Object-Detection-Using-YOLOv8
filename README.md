# YOLOv8 Object Detection Project

This project demonstrates object detection using YOLOv8 on the COCO dataset. The model can be used for training, evaluation, and testing on custom or standard datasets.

## Project Overview

This repository trains and evaluates a YOLOv8 model on the COCO dataset to detect multiple objects in images. YOLOv8 is a highly efficient model, known for speed and accuracy in real-time applications. The project is set up in Python using PyTorch.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- YOLOv8
- COCO dataset

You can install the dependencies with:
```bash
pip install ultralytics
```

## Model Implementation and Using method

Execute all the cells in the ObjectDetection.ipnby and then in new cell by using Detect_Object() funtion by passing path of the image for ojection detection.

Example:
```bash
Detect_Object('/path/image.jpg')
```
